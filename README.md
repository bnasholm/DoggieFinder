# Doggie Finder

This is a **Dog Adoption Webiste** built using **React** and **TypeScript**. It displays adoptable dogs based on search criteria with ability to filter and sort by Breed, Age, Name, and Zip code. Dogs can be added to a Favorites list and then a match can be generated for those on the favorites list.

## Live Demo
